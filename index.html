	    <h1>Paige Fishman and Gabby Birenbaum</h1>
	    <h2> By Shannon Sun </h2>
	    <p>Paige Fishman and Gabby Birenbaum's relationship is all about food. They eat almost every meal together, and they have daily conflicts about where to dine. Mexican food, burgers, sushi or Hinman food—there are just too many options. By the end of the day, though, both are always satisfied with whatever they ate, talking and laughing until they fight all over again about where to dine tomorrow.</p>
		<p> Fishman of Chicago and Birenbaum of Arlington, Virginia, make an unlikely pair. While Fishman wants to eat every meal out, Birenbaum said she does not want to spend too much money. While Fishman tends to overthink situations, Birenbaum said she is more flexible and carefree. Although from different backgrounds, the two share a mutual sense of compassion and open-mindedness.</p>
		<p>"If Paige says 'jump,' I’ll say 'how high,'"Birenbaum said. "We have a lot of spontaneous adventures together, and we just go with the flow. I don't know if I've ever connected with someone that well, and I'm really grateful to be her best friend for five weeks." </p>
		<p> For Fishman's birthday, Birenbaum even orchestrated a group dinner in downtown Evanston. Birenbaum managed to invite a group of friends to celebrate Fishman's birthday, even though it was one of the first few days of the program. </p>
		<p>Throughout their time here, food has continued to be the remedy to their stressful workdays. Birenbaum and Fishman ate sushi in Evanston once after an exhausting day of work, and they both called this dinner a "date." Between mouthfuls, the stress and weight of a demanding workday gradually dissolved. </p>
		<p>"We're basically co-dependent," Fishman said.</p>
		<p>"Paige is my soul sister," Birenbaum said.</p>
		<p> "Wait," Fishman said. "I was gonna say the same thing!"</p>

    <h1>Max Cohen and Bobby Kirschenbaum</h1>
    <h2> By Andrew Golden </h2>
    <p>Roommates Bobby Kirschenbaum, a cherub from Tenafly, New Jersey, and Max Cohen, a cherub from Washington D.C., have formed a close bond over the past five weeks. It started with their love for sports.</p>
	<p>"After a few minutes I found out that he was a Yankees fan," Kirschenbaum said. "I figured that's one thing we can connect to. We are really similar: He plays soccer, I play basketball. He follows sports, I follow sports."</p>
	<p>Cohen said his connection with his roommate grew stronger over time because Kirschenbaum reminded him of his roots in New Jersey.</p>
	<p>"Bobby has that classic New Jersey accent, and that endeared me to him," Cohen said. "I'm from DC, but all of my family is in New York and New Jersey."</p>
	<p>However, as their friendship developed over time, Kirschenbaum realized that Cohen's quiet demeanor was not his true personality.</p>
	<p>"I figured out that Max gives you that quiet impression," Kirschenbaum said. "But he's really funny and loud, and from there, every day we got a little bit closer."</p>
	<p>Cohen and Kirshenbaum both agree that they are very compatible roommates, noting that their habits are very similar: They go sleep and wake up around the same time.</p>
	<p>Although they are compatible roommates, they have had their share of arguments along the way over things as trivial as turning off an alarm. Cohen said they even have a competition for who has to turn off the alarm first.</p>
	<p>"The first couple of weeks, I was always turning it off," Cohen said. "Then I was like 'Wait, why am I always doing it?' So I sat in my bed, and five minutes passed until Bobby got up and turned it off, so that was a big victory for me."</p>
	<p>Despite the disputes, Kirschenbaum said he thinks he and Cohen have a friendship that will last a lifetime.</p>
	<p>"Max and I get closer everyday," Kirschenbaum said. "He always seems to make me laugh, and I'm fortunate to have had him as a roommate."</p>

	    <h1>Aidan Berg and Adrian Wan</h1>
	    <h2> By Andrew Golden </h2>
	    <p>Because of his background, Adrian Wan of Shenzhen, China was worried he would experience discrimination at Medill cherubs. Wan said this was a common fear among the international student community. When he met his roommate, Aidan Berg of Minneapolis, Minnesota, his fears dissolved.</p>
    	<p>"I think it's kind of universal for foreign students to go to another country, and I think it's a very common fear," Wan said.</p>
    	<p> But after meeting Berg, his mindset about Americans quickly changed.</p>
    	<p>"The first time I met Aidan, he was so kind," Wan said. "My journey to this place was so terrible. I felt kind of sad that day, but Aidan was just comforting me... people are very friendly."</p>
    	<p>Berg and Wan quickly formed a bond over time and began to understand each others' sleeping and showering habits. Berg and Wan may have been from different backgrounds, but that did not change how they acted or treated one another.</p>
    	<p>"We aren't really different," Berg said. "Being from different countries doesn't make a huge difference, I guess, because we both live pretty similarly."</p>
    	<p>Wan tried to spread some of his Chinese culture to many of his fellow cherubs, beyond more than just his roommate.</p>
    	<p>"I actually taught so many cherubs Chinese phrases and words," Wan said. “And one of the things I remember the most is that Bobby (Kirschenbaum) learned a phrase in Chinese that means 'I love you,' and he keeps saying it to me and I feel so... I don't know how to describe."</p>
    	<p>Although Berg and Wan's hometowns may be 7,438 miles apart, they both hope that they will keep in touch, even when cherubs is over.</p>

	    <h1>Nora Crumley and Nina Cong</h1>
	    <h2> By Shannon Sun </h2>
	    <p>While Nora Crumley of Winnetka, Illinois, traveled 20 minutes by car to arrive at the Medill-Northwestern Journalism Institute, Nina Cong of Hangzhou, China took a 14-hour international flight by herself, dragging a giant suitcase and a backpack full of books. Crumley had never lived away from home, but Cong had already attended boarding school for five years, sharing a room with six students. </p>
		<p> "When I first saw that my roommate is from China, not gonna lie, I was scared," Crumley said. "There are huge cultural differences, and I don't want to offend her. But once I met her, I realized that she's an amazing and awe-inspiring person."</p>
		<p>Crumley and Cong are an example of the many pairs of cherub roommates from different cultural and racial backgrounds. </p>
		<p>Cong said she was nervous that she would not be able to communicate with an American roommate, because she is unfamiliar with American pop culture references and what American teenagers talk about in daily conversations. </p>
		<p>"I had anticipated that it would be hard for me to fit in, but the language barrier is more serious than I thought," Cong said. </p>
		<p>Crumley helped ease her anxiety about language.</p>
		<p>"Nora always thinks about what others feel," Cong said. "I come from China, and I cannot speak English fluently, but Nora will explain every word that I don't understand. On the first few days, she would ask me if she did anything strange in Chinese eyes."</p>
		<p>In sincere attempts to understand each other, both took a leap into unfamiliar cultural territories. Crumley recommended that Cong watch "Flash," an American television series about a crime-fighter who moves at superhuman speeds. In exchange, Cong showed Crumley “Empresses in the Palace," a popular Chinese drama about the emperor and his concubines in the Qing Dynasty. The pair bonded over laughter, food and a mutual passion for journalism. </p>
		<p>Cong will also never forget her first birthday in the United States, which she said was special because of Crumley. Crumley brought a group of friends to celebrate Cong's birthday at Koi Fine Asian Cuisine in downtown Evanston. The rain started pouring while they were eating, so they dashed back to the dorms without an umbrella.</p>
		<p>"There was lightening and the wind almost lifted me entirely off the ground at some point, but we made it through," Crumley said. </p>
		<p>Crumley agreed that she would never forget this unlikely birthday celebration, filled with exhilarating joy and rooted in deep friendship.</p>
		<p>"I hope to stay in contact with Nina, and I hope that she will call me the very first second she comes back to America again," Crumley said.</p>
		<p>Cong's eyes shined with tears as she thought about leaving Medill cherubs. After a long pause, Cong leaned back on the basil-colored couch and took a deep breath.</p>
		<p>"Our relationship is like moonlight. It's gentle and subtle, and it gradually penetrates into your life," Cong said. "Even if you haven't noticed, it is always there, and it makes you comfortable."</p>
