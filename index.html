	    <h1>Paige Fishman and Gabby Birenbaum</h1>
	    <p>While Nora Crumley of Winnetka, Illinois, traveled 20 minutes by car to arrive at the Medill-Northwestern Journalism Institute, Nina Cong of Hangzhou, China took a 14-hour international flight by herself, dragging a giant suitcase and a backpack full of books. Crumley had never lived away from home, but Cong had already attended boarding school for five years, sharing a room with six students. </p>
		<p> "When I first saw that my roommate is from China, not gonna lie, I was scared," Crumley said. "There are huge cultural differences, and I don't want to offend her. But once I met her, I realized that she's an amazing and awe-inspiring person."</p>
		<p>Crumley and Cong are an example of the many pairs of cherub roommates from different cultural and racial backgrounds. </p>
		<p>Cong said she was nervous that she would not be able to communicate with an American roommate, because she is unfamiliar with American pop culture references and what American teenagers talk about in daily conversations. </p>
		<p>"I had anticipated that it would be hard for me to fit in, but the language barrier is more serious than I thought," Cong said. </p>
		<p>Crumley helped ease her anxiety about language.</p>
		<p>"Nora always thinks about what others' feel," Cong said. "I come from China, and I cannot speak English fluently, but Nora will explain every word that I don't understand. On the first few days, she would ask me if she did anything strange in Chinese eyes."</p>
		<p>In sincere attempts to understand each other, both took a leap into unfamiliar cultural territories. Crumley recommended that Cong watch "Flash," an American television series about a crime-fighter who moves at superhuman speeds. In exchange, Cong showed Crumley “Empresses in the Palace," a popular Chinese drama about the emperor and his concubines in the Qing Dynasty. The pair bonded over laughter, food and a mutual passion for journalism. </p>
		<p>Cong will also never forget her first birthday in the United States, which she said was special because of Crumley. Crumley brought a group of friends to celebrate Cong's birthday at Koi Fine Asian Cuisine in downtown Evanston. The rain started pouring while they were eating, so they dashed back to the dorms without an umbrella.</p>
		<p>"There was lightening and the wind almost lifted me entirely off the ground at some point, but we made it through," Crumley said. </p>
		<p>Crumley agreed that she would never forget this unlikely birthday celebration, filled with exhilarating joy and rooted in deep friendship.</p>
		<p>"I hope to stay in contact with Nina, and I hope that she will call me the very first second she comes back to America again," Crumley said.</p>
		<p>Cong's eyes shined with tears as she thought about leaving Medill cherubs. After a long pause, Cong leaned back on the basil-colored couch and took a deep breath.</p>
		<p>"Our relationship is like moonlight. It's gentle and subtle, and it gradually penetrates into your life," Cong said. "Even if you haven't noticed, it is always there, and it makes you comfortable."</p>
